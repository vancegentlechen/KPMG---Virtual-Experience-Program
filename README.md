# KPMG---Virtual-Experience-Program
## Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation,needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:


>Customer Demographic

>Customer Addresses

>Transactions data

##Problem Statement

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation.

We have to reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

The Program has divided the solution into three tasks.

1.Data Quality Assessment

2.Data Insights

3.Data Insights and Presentation

## Data Quality Assessment

The importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance we will be able to use it drive company growth.


Task - _Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues._

## Data Insights

Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, I have to recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation.

In building this recommendation, I need to start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - _Data Exploration, Model Development and Interpretation._

Task - _Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off._

## Data Insights and Presentation

Task - _Develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard._

>Which customer segment has the highest customer value?

>What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?

>Specifically, your presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list as well as the broader market segment to reach out to.
